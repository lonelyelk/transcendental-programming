# Code Golf

Code golf is the art of solving programming problems with the shortest possible code.
It focuses on minimizing character count while maintaining correctness without any regard for
the readability.

## Philosophy

Golf teaches you to:

- Understand language features deeply
- Find creative solutions within constraints
- Appreciate the terseness vs. clarity tradeoff
- Explore the boundaries of syntax
